<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
Embedded and Intelligent Systems Engineer with experience in precision measurement, 
signal filtering, and control system development. 
Worked on industrial R&D projects involving PT1000-based temperature acquisition 
and estimation models supported by ANN techniques.

Professionally active for over four years in cross-platform mobile development using Flutter, 
delivering production-ready applications across multiple platforms. 
My work integrates strong engineering fundamentals with modern software architecture.

Seeking opportunities in R&D-focused and technology-driven environments, 
including international and EU-funded projects.
